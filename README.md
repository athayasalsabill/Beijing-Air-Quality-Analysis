### Air Quality Analysis
I use Air Quality Data containing measurements of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3) and meteorological variables (temperature, pressure, wind speed, etc.) collected from twelve stations in Beijing.

To see my streamlit app about this analysis you can copy the url from url.txt.

The folder 'data' contains data i use for the analysis. The code for analysis is at the 'notebook.ipynb' file. Analysis result files are in the 'dashboard' folder. The 'dashboard.py' in dashboard folder is the code for streamlit app.
